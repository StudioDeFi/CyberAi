## Key Findings

### Merged / Landed
- GitHub Pages migration is complete (`CNAME`, `pages-deploy.yml` present in main).
- Advanced build system (esbuild, Dockerfile, turbo.json, Makefile) is merged.
- ESLint flat config is in place (`eslint.config.js`).
- Lock files are regenerated and consistent.

### Stale Branches
- Multiple `sub-pr-*` branches (27, 38, 50 — 4 variants each) are stale artifacts from automated sub-PR retries. These can be safely deleted.
- `cyberai/pipeline-bootstrap` has no corresponding files on `main` and appears abandoned.
- `copilot/initialize-control-plane-infrastructure` has no corresponding code on `main`.

### Auto-managed
- All `dependabot/*` branches are auto-managed by GitHub Dependabot and should not be merged manually.

## Recommendations

1. **Delete stale sub-PR branches**: `sub-pr-27`, `sub-pr-27-again`, `sub-pr-27-another-one`, `sub-pr-27-yet-again`, `sub-pr-38`, `sub-pr-38-again`, `sub-pr-38-another-one`, `sub-pr-50`, `sub-pr-50-again`, `sub-pr-50-another-one`, `sub-pr-50-yet-again`.
2. **Delete abandoned branches**: `cyberai/pipeline-bootstrap`, `copilot/initialize-control-plane-infrastructure`.
3. **Review and close**: `copilot/add-professional-auto-commenting-system` — the CI commenting feature was intentionally removed.
4. **Keep**: All `dependabot/*` branches — managed automatically.
5. **Merge this PR**: `copilot/optimize-cyberai-ui-ux` — delivers the full UI/UX upgrade.
